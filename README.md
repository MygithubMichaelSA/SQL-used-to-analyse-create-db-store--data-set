# SQL-used-to-analyse-create-db-store--data-set
Database: create-db-store
The SQL programming language was used to analyse the database, on the MySQL software tool.
Specfically, I used different functions, from the Data Manipulation language, to produce different queries about the data.
I have also made chagnges to the orifinal 'create-db-store' datset, and justified my changes on each code line and on a seperate Microsoft Word document (all attached in this repository).
